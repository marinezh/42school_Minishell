make: *** [Makefile:65: minishell] Error 1

to avoide this mistake i changed Makefile settings , added -pie flag

From Inna:
-switched to your branch 3-parsing, tried to compile on mac, had the error below
/libft library created
clang: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-pie' [-Wunused-command-line-argument]
/minishell created
- I also checked in GPTchat what error is about and one of the reasons - static variable in obj/process_redir.o
- But there are no static variables in this function
- there is one static variable in a different fucntion. everything compiles without this flag just fine in my branch
- in get next line we had static variable and didn't add any flags
- when you are back, let's try together to check
